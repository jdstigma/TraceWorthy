/**
 * Per-state and federal contacts for reporting spoofed / harassing calls.
 *
 * USA-only. The traceback mechanism is federal (FCC / TRACED Act) and identical
 * in every state, so there is no per-state document pile — only WHO you contact
 * differs. Each state's Attorney General also accepts robocall/spoofing
 * complaints; the official .gov sites below are the current complaint portals.
 *
 * Reviewed July 2026. Government URLs and numbers change — the app also links to
 * USA.gov's always-current official finder as a safety net, and shows a Verify
 * option, so a stale row here never leaves a user stranded.
