# Signing release APKs

A **signed** APK carries a cryptographic identity so Android (and users) can trust
that updates come from the same author. The signing config and CI are already set
up — you just create a keystore once and add it as GitHub Secrets. After that,
**publishing a release automatically builds and attaches a signed APK.**

> Keep the keystore file and its passwords safe and backed up. If you lose them you
> can never ship an update under the same identity — you'd have to start over with
> a new app identity. The keystore is git-ignored on purpose; never commit it.

## One-time setup (run these on your PC)

### 1. Create the keystore
`keytool` ships with the JDK / Android Studio. In a terminal:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore traceworthy-release.jks -alias traceworthy \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

It prompts you to choose a **keystore password** and a **key password** (you can
use the same for both) and asks for name/org details (any values are fine). This
produces `traceworthy-release.jks`.

### 2. Base64-encode it (so it can live in a secret)

PowerShell:
```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("traceworthy-release.jks")) > keystore.b64
```
or Git Bash:
```bash
base64 -w0 traceworthy-release.jks > keystore.b64
```

### 3. Add the four GitHub Secrets
Using the GitHub CLI (already authenticated as you):

```bash
gh secret set KEYSTORE_BASE64   --repo jdstigma/TraceWorthy < keystore.b64
gh secret set KEYSTORE_PASSWORD --repo jdstigma/TraceWorthy --body "YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"
gh secret set KEY_ALIAS         --repo jdstigma/TraceWorthy --body "traceworthy"
gh secret set KEY_PASSWORD      --repo jdstigma/TraceWorthy --body "YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD"
```

(Or add them in the browser: repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.)

### 4. Clean up local copies
Delete `keystore.b64` after uploading. Keep `traceworthy-release.jks` and the
passwords somewhere safe and backed up (a password manager is ideal).

## Cutting a signed release

Once the secrets are set, every time you **publish a GitHub release** two CI jobs
run: `release-apk` builds a signed `app-release.apk` with your keystore, and
`release-exe` builds `TraceWorthy.exe` — both are attached to that release.

```bash
# bump versionName/versionCode in android/app/build.gradle.kts first, then:
gh release create v1.0.3 --repo jdstigma/TraceWorthy --title "TraceWorthy v1.0.3" --notes "..."
```

Watch it: `gh run watch` — when green, the signed APK and the exe are attached.

> Signing is active as of v1.0.1 (v1.0.1 and v1.0.2 ship signed APKs); each new
> release is signed automatically. Only the original v1.0.0 release is unsigned.

## How the pieces connect
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts` — a `release` signing config that reads
  `KEYSTORE_FILE / KEYSTORE_PASSWORD / KEY_ALIAS / KEY_PASSWORD` from the
  environment (only active when those are present, so local builds are unaffected).
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` — the `release-apk` job decodes the keystore from
  `KEYSTORE_BASE64`, sets those env vars from your secrets, builds, and attaches
  the signed APK to the published release.
